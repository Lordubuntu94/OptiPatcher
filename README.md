## OptiPatcher
An **ASI Plugin for OptiScaler** for exposing DLSS/DLSS-FG inputs without spoofing in supported games.  

> [!NOTE]
> * It should help Intel Arc users most because with newer versions of Unreal Engine spoofing has issues, causing `D3D12 not supported` errors.  
> * Now with DLSSG patching, all AMD/Intel users benefit too.  


### Installation
* Create a `plugins` folder where Opti is installed and put `OptiPatcher.asi` in this folder.  
* Enable ASI loading from `OptiScaler.ini`
* ~and disable Dxgi spoofing~ (_Opti automatically does this part since 0.7.7-pre13_0731 so `Dxgi=false` isn't needed anymore_).

```ini
LoadAsiPlugins=true
```

> [!NOTE]
> _**Shouldn't be required with latest Nightly 0731 anymore**_
> * ~There's a bug in OptiScaler currently where you have to set the plugin path for it to properly locate them~  
> * ~Set `Path=plugins` in OptiScaler.ini (option right above `LoadAsiPlugins`)~

**Warning** I have double checked patch patterns from my notes, but crashes might occur.

> [!NOTE]
> ### Special notes
> * Robocop Rogue City and Unfinished Business DLSS plugin is patched, but due to extra checks when not spoofing, to expose DLSS/DLSS-FG properly, requires setting `UpscalingMethod=2` in **GameUserSettings.ini** in `AppData\Local\RoboCop\Saved\Config\Windows` (also maybe `NvidiaReflexLowLatency=1` if it isn't exposed already)  
> * To get XeFG 2.1 for non-Intel GPUs, just replace the XeSS files in `Robocop Rogue City\Engine\Plugins\Runtime\Intel\XeSS\Binaries\ThirdParty\Win64`
